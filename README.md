# Queueing_Project_SFI
Work from Summer 2021 SFI UCR program 


Over the Summer I worked at the Santa Fe Institute with Sid Redner, Andres Ortiz-Munoz and George Cantwell on a projected related to Queueing Theory.
This Repository Contains a m/m/1 queue simulation as well as an item based simulation titled bunches.
In bunches the model represents a supermarket where items arrive in bunches (shopping carts) and are serviced one at a time.
